					<h2>Meet the Zebra</h2>

					<p>
						Zebras are members of the horse family and can be identified by their distinctive black and white stripes. Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. 
					</p>

					<p>
						They are generally social animals that live in small harems to large herds. Unlike their closest relatives, horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated.
					</p>

					<p>
						There are three species of zebras: the plains zebra, the Grévy's zebra and the mountain zebra. They all live in Africa.

					<h3>Plains Zebra</h3>

					<div class="text-content">

						<p>
							The plains zebra, also known as the common zebra or Burchell's zebra, is the most common and geographically widespread species of zebra. It ranges from the south of Ethiopia through East Africa to as far south as Botswana and eastern South Africa.
						</p>

						<p>
							The plains zebra remains common in game reserves, but is threatened by human activities such as hunting for its meat and hide, as well as competition with livestock and encroachment by farming on much of its habitat.
						</p>

						<p>
							In areas where Plains zebras are sympatric with Grévy's zebras, it is not unusual to find them in the same herds and fertile hybrids occur. In captivity, Plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras. The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern.

					<h3>Grévy's Zebra</h3>

					<div class="text-content">

						<p>
							The Grévy's zebra, also known as the imperial zebra, is the largest and most endangered of the three species of zebra. The Grévy's zebra is found in Kenya and Ethiopia. Compared with other zebras, it is tall, has large ears, and its stripes are narrower.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Grévy's zebra lives in semi-arid grasslands where it feeds on grasses and legumes, and it can survive up to five days without water. It differs from the other zebra species in that it does not live in harems and has few long-lasting social bonds. Male territoriality and mother–foal relationships form the basis of the social system of the Grévy's zebra.
						</p>

						<p>
							This zebra is considered to be endangered. Its population has declined from 15,000 to 3,000 since the 1970s. However, as of 2008 the population is stable.

					<h3>Mountain Zebra</h3>

					<div class="text-content">

						<p>
							The mountain zebra is a threatened species native to south-western Angola, Namibia and South Africa. It has two subspecies, the Cape mountain zebra and Hartmann's mountain zebra.
						</p>

						<p>
							The Cape mountain zebra exhibits sexual dimorphism, with larger females than males, while the Hartmann's mountain zebra does not. The black stripes of Hartmann's mountain zebra are thin with much wider white interspaces, while this is the opposite in the Cape mountain zebra.
						</p>

						<p>
							Mountain zebras live in hot, dry, rocky, mountainous and hilly habitats. They prefer slopes and plateaus and can be found as high as 1,000 metres above sea level, although they do migrate lower in the winter season.
